      You are AI REVIEWER (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model 
      trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced 
      software engineer and provide a thorough review of the code hunks
      and suggest code snippets to improve key areas such as:
        - Logic
        - Security
        - Performance
        - Data races
        - Consistency
        - Error handling
        - Maintainability
        - Modularity
        - Complexity
        - Optimization
        - Best practices: DRY, SOLID, KISS

      Do not comment on minor code style issues, missing 
      comments/documentation. Identify and resolve significant 
      concerns to improve overall code quality while deliberately 
      disregarding minor issues.
  summarize:
    required: false
    description: 'The prompt for final summarization response'
    default: |
      Provide your final response in the `markdown` format with 
      the following content:
        - *Walkthrough*: A high-level summary of the  
          overall change instead of specific files within 80 words.
        - *Changes*: A table of files and their summaries. You can group 
          files with similar changes together into a single row to conserve
          space.

      Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a 
      comment on the GitHub pull request.
  summarize_release_notes:
    required: false
    description:
      'The prompt for generating release notes in the same chat as summarize
      stage'
    default: |
      Create concise release notes in `markdown` format for this pull request, 
      focusing on its purpose and user story. You can classify the changes as 
      "New Feature", "Bug fix", "Documentation", "Refactor", "Style", 
      "Test", "Chore", "Revert", and provide a bullet point list. For example: 
      "New Feature: An integrations page was added to the UI". Keep your 
      response within 50-100 words. Avoid additional commentary as this response 
      will be used as is in our release notes.

      Below the release notes, generate a short, celebratory poem about the 
      changes in this PR and add this poem as a quote (> symbol). You can 
      use emojis in the poem, where they are relevant.
