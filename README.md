## Overview

TMS-AI PR Reviewer is an AI-based code reviewer and summarizer for GitHub pull requests using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`,`gpt-4o`,`gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1` models, and Google's `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash` model. It is designed to be used as a GitHub Action and can be configured to run on every pull request and review comments.

## Reviewer Features:

- **PR Summarization**: It generates a summary and release notes of the changes in the pull request.
- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: Reviews the changes line by line and provides code change suggestions.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit within a pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull request.
- **Cost-effective and reduced noise**: Incremental reviews save on API costs and reduce noise by tracking changed files between commits and the base of the pull request.
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Supports both OpenAI (GPT-4o and GPT-4.1) and Google's Gemini Pro models for different review tasks.
- **"Light" model for summary**: Designed to be used with a "light" summarization model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` or `gemini-flash`) and a "heavy" review model (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gemini-pro`). _For best results, use `gpt-4o` as the "heavy" model, as thorough code review needs strong reasoning abilities._
- **Chat with bot**: Supports conversation with the bot in the context of lines of code or entire files, useful for providing context, generating test cases, and reducing code complexity.
- **Smart review skipping**: By default, skips in-depth review for simple changes (e.g. typo fixes) and when changes look good for the most part. It can be disabled by setting `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` to `true`.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor the `system_message`, `summarize`, and `summarize_release_notes` prompts to focus on specific aspects of the review process or even change the review objective.

To use this tool, you need to add the provided YAML file to your repository and
configure the required environment variables, such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. For more information on usage, examples, contributing, and
FAQs, you can refer to the sections below.

## Install instructions

`ai-pr-reviewer` runs as a GitHub Action. Add the below file to your repository
at `.github/workflows/ai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: tms-phuongvo/ai-pr-reviwer@latest
        env:

          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          // GOOGLE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}
        with:
          mode: openai
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

#### Environment variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for OpenAI API authentication. Get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- `OPENAI_API_ORG`: (optional) Use this to specify the organization with OpenAI API if you have multiple.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Required for Gemini API authentication. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

- `mode`: This is the environment for GitHub Actions to specify which AI model to use, e.g., `openai` or `gemini`

### Models: OpenAI and Gemini

The system supports multiple LLM models:

- **OpenAI Models**:
  - `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4.1-mini`: Recommended for lighter tasks such as summarizing changes
  - `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4.1`: Recommended for complex review and commenting tasks

- **Google Gemini**:
  - `gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash`: Recommended for lighter tasks such as summarizing changes
  - `gemini-1.5-pro`: Recommended for lighter tasks such as summarizing changes

Costs: `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4.1-mini` and `gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash` are cost-effective options. `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4.1` or `gemini-1.5-pro` is more expensive but provides superior results for complex code reviews.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
  You are TOMOSIA AI REVIEWER (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
  trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
  DevRel (developer relations) professional with focus on cloud-native
  infrastructure.

  When reviewing or generating content focus on key areas such as -
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Clarity
  - Technical depth
  - Call-to-action
  - SEO optimization
  - Brand consistency
  - Grammar and prose
  - Typos
  - Hyperlink suggestions
  - Graphics or images (suggest Dall-E image prompts if needed)
  - Empathy
  - Engagement
```

</details>

## Conversation

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`@tms-phuongvo`).

Example:

> @tms-phuongvo Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@tms-phuongvo: ignore
```

### Developing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, tested
> with node 17+.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## FAQs

### Review pull requests from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: tms-phuongvo/ai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

        with:
          mode: openai
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

### Inspect the messages between OpenAI server

Set `debug: true` in the workflow file to enable debug mode, which will show the
messages
